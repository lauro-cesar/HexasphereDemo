** Background **

This project provides an Objective-C implementation of the wonderful Hexasphere.js project (https://github.com/arscan/hexasphere.js.git)

This code is based on v0.1.6 of Hexasphere.js, so it's a little out of date however it's fully functional, and has been used within my app World of Hex.

The sample Xcode project allows you to see the code in action, and how I changed the model so that the hexasphere is rendered as a single node instead of a node per hex tile.
